## Prioritise Performance

+ Be careful which properties you animate, some are more expensive than others.
+ Ensure that you know the impact of animating a given CSS property.
   + Animating properties that change the geometry of the page(layout) are particularly expensive.
   + When you can, stick to changing transforms and opacity.
+ Use "will-change" to ensure that the browser knows what you plan to animate.
