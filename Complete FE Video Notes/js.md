+ getelementbyID takes only 1 parameter (i.e), the ID of the content in HTML.
+ element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture);
The first parameter is the type of the event (like "click" or "mousedown" or any other HTML DOM Event.)

The second parameter is the function we want to call when the event occurs.
