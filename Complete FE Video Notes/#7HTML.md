# Inline and block level

+ A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full
  width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can)
  Eg: div

+ An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as
  much width as necessary
  Eg: span

  An inline element can not contain a block-level element.
