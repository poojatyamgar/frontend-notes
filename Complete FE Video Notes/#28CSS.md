#### CSS Coding best practices

+ Add a favicon in title section.
+ Use ID's less instead use CLASS.
   + ID's should be used only for navigation and meaning of tags and scripting purposes.
   + For JS we need ID's
   + For styling we should always use CLASS.
+ Don't create unnecessary classes.
 Eg: "centerclass, whiteclass"
+ Avoid inline styling at all costs.
+ DRY (Don't repeat yourself)
+ For general tags we can have general styling, but specific styling should be in specific class tags only.
