## Good UX Principles

+ UX:-
  + The users experience with the design.

## User research and Usability Testing

+ Your thoughts vs user behavior
+ Mobile version not too scaled down nor having little content to show.
+ Styling can sometimes make your page less accessible so test with users and gain feedback.

## Usability

+ Simplicity - **Design with aesthetics and minimalism in mind** - do not clutter with unnecessary items.
+ Usability first before design aesthetic.

## Consistency

+ Use common elements
+ Keep a single way of doing everything in your app.(A car, a certain day whose break and acceleratr and break is swapped positions.)
+ Use same CSS and layout.
+ Keep design consistent.
+ Nobody likes to relearn anything.
+ Make users confident in using your app.
+ Be consistent with user expectations- least surpridses.
+ Do not hinder users with nice-to-haves unnecessarily.
+ Do not reinvent user patterns
+ Do not reinvent terminology.
Eg: use checkout instead of billing.

## Dark Patterns

+ The good, the bad, and the **evil.**
+ Beneficial for the company but not for the user.
+ Clicking something to go to a webpage and do something but lead to something else.
