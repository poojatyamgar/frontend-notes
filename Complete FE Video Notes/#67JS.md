#   Closures

+ JS supports nested functions . Nested    
  functions have access to the scope
   "above" them.
+ This makes it possible for a function
  to have "private" variables.
+ A closure is a function having access to the 
  parent scope, even after the parent 
   function has closed.
+ Such functions retain the arguments
  defined inside the outer function
+ Even after the outer function has completed execution
+ JS preserves it due to 'Closures'
+ For Closures and Loops, always use "let".

#    Function Factory

+ Functions are first clas datatypes
+ Whatever we can do to any variable or objects, we can do to functions.
+ The value of function name is entire
   function definition itself.
+ So we can create a 'Function factory' using
   ths.
