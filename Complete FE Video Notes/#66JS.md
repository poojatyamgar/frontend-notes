# Scope chain

+ Everything is executed in an execution context
+ Function invocation creates a new execution
   context
+ Each execution context has -
   + its own variable environment
   + A special 'this' object
   + reference to its outer environment
   + Global doesn't have outer
+ A referenced (not defined) variable
  will be searched for in its current 
  scope first
+ If not found, the outer reference 
  will be searched
+ If not found, the outer reference's
  outer reference will be searched
+ This will keep going until the Gloabl
  scope.
+ If not found in global scope, the
  variable is undefined.

#    'This'

+ 'This' pointer points to the object which has invoked the function.
+ Functions defined with the function keyword
  use 'this' to manipulate the calling oject.
+ In a method, this refers to the owner object.
+ Beware of 'this'!
