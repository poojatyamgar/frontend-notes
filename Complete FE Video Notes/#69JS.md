#    call(), apply() and bind()

+ With call(), an object can use a method
  belonging to another object
+ call() and apply() serve the exact same
  purpose.
+ But call() expects an array of all our
  parameters
+ The bind() method creates a new function
  that, when called, has its 'this'
   keyword set to the provided value.

#    Prototype

+  The most popular model of OOP is class based.
+ JS isn't a class-based language - it is a 
   prototype-based language.
+ It has all the code required for each object
  created using a constructor.
+ Adding a method to a class is same as adding
  a method to the prototype object.

----

#    Template Literals

+ Ease with template literals.
+ Multiline possible.
+ Curly braces should return a string.

# Inheritance

+ It - extends all properties
  and methods from parent.
+ If derived class has a constructor, iot must have a super
constructor call first in it. 
So that first, the parent is setup.
+ Call all methods of super class in subclass using 
super.methodname();
+ Polymorphism

# Prototype inheritance

+ Objects Inherit from Objects using create()
+ Function prototypes
+ Prototype subclassing
+ Difference between class & prototype inheritance.
