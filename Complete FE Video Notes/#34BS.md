# Best Practices
+ Use IDs for all sections of your webpage for having links to them directly. Specially for SPAs
+ Visit "bootstrapmade.com", "globekit.co"
+ Never change the bootstrap code files. Add custom classes and use specificity to help you.
+ If you need to create your own style like bootstrap with minor modifications, then go to bootstrap.css and copy from there.
+ If we don't need further containers, then don't make new divs, rather make sections.
+ Have different resolutions and sizes for the images to use on different sizes of screen.
